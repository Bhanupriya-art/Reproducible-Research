# Reproducible Research - Week 4 Assignment

#### This Assignment is part of Reproducible Research Course by Coursera.

#### This project explores the NOAA storm database, which tracks major storms and weather events, to address the most severe types of weather events in the USA, which caused greatest damage to human population in terms of fatalities/injuries and economic loss during the years 1950 - 2011.

#### There are two goals of this analysis:
- identify the weather events that are most harmful with respect to population health
- identify the weather events that have the greatest economic consequences.
